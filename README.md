# talking_cats
My projects for Android Academy SPb 2018.
Just an entertainable sample of Android feachures.

Here are our homeworks for the course.

Tasks:

1. Create an app in Android studio wich says "Hello World"
--> Created an app wich begins with a splash screen.

2. Create an activity with user input and two buttons: one should start a new activity and display that input, second should open a post app to send the input via E-mail, giving a mail its subject automatically.
--> Done; created both portrait and landscape versions; also made the app display texts in two languages (RU, ENG) using @res/values.

3. Create an activity with the layout as shown here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Android-Academy-SPB/Lecture2-Exercise/master/images/img_1.jpg 
--> Done; buttons added to get to the activity from the other activities.

4. Create an activity with RecyclerView, showing a list of cat photos; pressing any photo in list plays the cat meow sound. Mind the portrait and landscape leyouts. 
--> Done; also added cat sounds on every button (just for fun).
